// In a procedural language such as C, you think about actions and then write code to perform the action on various objects. Referring to the car example, you might write a procedure in C to wash a vehicle and then inside that procedure write code to handle washing a car, washing a boat, washing a motorcycle, and so on. If you took that approach and then wanted to add a new vehicle type (see the previous exercise), do you see advantages or disadvantages to using this procedural approach over an object- oriented approach?

// Answer: Advantage is  I dont need to rewrite the commands again, instead i only need to set the new vehicle type as a NSObject. As all of the vehicle types are set as NSObjects
