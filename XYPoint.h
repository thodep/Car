//Define a class called XYPoint that will hold a Cartesian coordinate (x, y), where x and y are integers. Define methods to individually set the x and y coordinates of a point and retrieve their values. Write an Objective-C program to implement your new class and test it.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>


@interface XYPoint : NSObject

@property  NSInteger x;
@property  NSInteger y;
